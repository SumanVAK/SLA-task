               <p style="text-align: justify;"> Eiichiro Oda (Japanese: 尾田 栄一郎, Hepburn: Oda Eiichirō; born January 1, 1975) is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the series One Piece, the best-selling manga in history and the best-selling comic series printed in volume. With more than 520 million tankōbon copies of One Piece in circulation worldwide, Oda is one of the best-selling fiction authors.[c] The series' popularity resulted in Oda being named one of the artists who changed the history of manga.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Eiichiro Oda was born on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto, Japan. At the age of four he resolved to become a manga artist in order to avoid having to get a "real job".[10] His biggest influence was Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball.[10][11] He recalls that his interest in pirates was probably sparked by the popular TV animation series titled Vicky the Viking.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">At the age of 17, Oda submitted his work Wanted! and won several awards, including second place in the coveted Tezuka Award. That got him into a job at the Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine, where he originally worked as assistant manga artist/assistant to Shinobu Kaitani's series Suizan Police Gang before moving to Masaya Tokuhiro on Jungle King Tar-chan and Mizu no Tomodachi Kappaman,[10] which gave him an unexpected influence on his artistic style. At the age of 19, he began working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki on Rurouni Kenshin, before winning the Hop Step Award for new manga artists. Watsuki credits Oda for helping create the character Honjō Kamatari who appears in Rurouni Kenshin.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">During this time, Oda drew two pirate-themed one-shot stories called "Romance Dawn", which were published in Akamaru Jump and Weekly Shōnen Jump respectively in late 1996.[14][15] "Romance Dawn" featured Monkey D. Luffy as the protagonist, who then became the protagonist of One Piece.</p>
            <P style="text-align: justify;">In 1997, One Piece began serialization in Weekly Shōnen Jump and has become not only one of the most popular manga in Japan, but the best-selling manga series of all time. It sold 100 million collected tankōbon volumes by February 2005,[16] over 200 million by February 2011,[16] had 320,866,000 copies printed worldwide by December 2014,[17] 430 million volumes in circulation worldwide as of October 2017,[18] 440 million copies sold as of May 2018[19] and 450 million in print as of March 2019</P>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In a 2008 poll, conducted by marketing research firm Oricon, Oda was elected fifth most favorite manga artists of Japan. He shared the place with Yoshihiro Togashi, creator of YuYu Hakusho and Hunter × Hunter.[24] In their 2010 poll on the Mangaka that Changed the History of Manga, Oda came in fourth.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Oda and Akira Toriyama created a 2007 crossover one-shot called Cross Epoch, that contains characters from Toriyama's Dragon Ball and Oda's One Piece. In 2013, they each designed a Gaist character for the video game Gaist Crusher.[29] In 2011, Oda and Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro created the One Piece and Toriko crossover one-shot Taste of the Devil Fruit. Shimabukuro stated that he came up with the bulk of the story while Oda gave suggestions.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2004, Eiichiro Oda has been married to Chiaki Inaba, a former model, actress and tarento. Oda met her in December 2002 during a Jump Festa festival where Chiaki Inaba played the role of Nami during a One Piece stage show. Oda and Inaba have two daughters, one born in 2006 and the other in 2009.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Oda regarded many mangaka both as his friends and rivals. Among these were his fellow assistants under Nobuhiro Watsuki; Hiroyuki Takei, and Mikio Itō. Still many years later, they remained good friends.[32] For the title page illustration of One Piece chapter 766, which ran in 2014's 50th issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump alongside the final two chapters of Kishimoto's Naruto, Oda included a hidden message and other tributes in the art.[33] Kishimoto himself also gave tribute in the ending of Naruto where the character Boruto Uzumaki makes a drawing of the Straw Hat Jolly Roger on a mountain.[34] Upon the release of Chapter 1,000 of One Piece, several of Oda's fellow mangaka rivals paid tribute in the author's comment section of Weekly Shōnen Jump by congratulating Oda for achieving this milestone.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">According to Oda himself and his manga editors, he is an ardent worker and perfectionist,[36] sleeping only three hours per day during a typical work week.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">He was hospitalized for a peritonsillar abscess in 2013 and later discharged from the hospital after two weeks. After a year, he underwent a tonsillectomy to completely cure his condition.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Oda gifted Kumamoto Prefecture ¥800 million (US$8M/£4.9M) in 2018 after it suffered a damaging earthquake in 2016 that had affected its iconic Kumamoto Castle. Oda's ¥800M donation was offered in two separate gifts, one for ¥500M under Luffy's name (Luffy's current bounty at the time) and a second donation of ¥300M. Eiichiro Oda has long been a supporter of earthquake-stricken areas, writing supportive messages, contributing art for local products, and participating in the ONE PIECE Kumamoto Revival Project</p>
